# BasicCalculator
This project is a simple Java console-based calculator that performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using user-defined methods.

It takes input from the user through the Scanner class, processes the chosen operation, and displays the result. 

A loop is used to repeatedly perform calculations until the user decides to exit, helping you understand Java syntax and program flow.
